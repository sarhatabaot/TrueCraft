## Compiling

**Use a recursive git clone.**

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/danielcrenna/TrueCraft.git

You need to restore Nuget packages. The easiest way is to open the solution up in monodevelop or visual studio or the like and build from there. 

## Assets

TrueCraft is compatible with Minecraft beta 1.7.3 texture packs. We ship the Pixeludi Pack (by Wojtek Mroczek) by default. You can install the Mojang assets through the TrueCraft launcher if you wish.
